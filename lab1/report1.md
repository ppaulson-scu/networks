# Description

Description of the XOR cipher and your program

The XOR cipher is pretty simple - given an input I and a key K, (I XOR K) is extremely difficult to decrypt without K.
However, ((I XOR K) XOR k) = I, which means that if you know the key, you can very easily decrypt a file. Additionally,
since XOR is a single operation, encryption and decryption are extremely fast.

# Q & A

1. Why is the XOR cipher important?
It is fast, simple to implement, and cryptographically secure.
2. Did you deal with super long files (that might run out of memory)?
Since the program only deals with a single byte of data at a time, a longer file only increases runtime and does not require additional memory.
3. What is your programming background?
C/C++ at SCU, Java and a bit of Lua for personal projects.
4. How comfortable are you with Linux machines?
Pretty comfortable with the basic functions, but I do not know many of the smaller things.
5. What is a fun fact about yourself?
I am an Eagle Scout.
